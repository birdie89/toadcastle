# Arrival Procedure (Winter)

Welcome to Toad Castle\! There are a few things you have to do to open the castle: 

- **Unlock the doors**  
- **Turn on the water pump & heater**   
- **Turn on heat pumps and light a fire**

 Let’s get started 

### **Unlock the doors**

1. The keys are in a lockbox attached to the mudroom door. The mudroom door is the first door around the corner from the shop door along the porch (in the corner between the shop door and the front door).   
   **Lockbox Code: 8888**  
2. The keys open the workshop door (red).   
3. Once inside, you can unlock the other doors from the inside. No keys required. 

### **Turn on the water pump & heater**

This is the most challenging \- and dare I say exciting \- part of the job, get ready\! 

1. Using the trapdoor in the workshop, go downstairs into the basement. The basement lights are immediately on your right on the ceiling/floor beside the trap door opening.   
2. Go to the electrical panel, located just after the first doorway in the basement. Immediately on your left you’ll see the electrical panel.  
3. Turn on breakers **29** and **31** if they’re off (Hint: everything else on that side/column is in the ON position, so the pump switches are ON when they’re in the same position as the other switches in their side/column.)  
     
4. Continue towards the far end of the basement, past the gym, and through the doorway into the dirt floor area. Light is above your right shoulder on the doorway, turn it on.   
5. Walk to the far right corner where you’ll find the pump and plumbing. You’ll see a grey box \- the pump pressure switch \- on the water pipe in front of the bright blue pressure tank. The pressure switch looks like this:   
     
6. This pump has a small metal switch sticking out, with 3 controls: **ON/AUTO** is at 9 o’clock, **START** is at 10:30, and **OFF** is at 12\.   
7. Move the switch to the  **START** position and hold for about 10 seconds. You should hear the sound of water rushing. Watch the pressure gauge climb and once it gets to about 25 psi, let go of the switch and the switch will move back to ON/AUTO.  
     
8. Watch the pressure for a few seconds to make sure it reaches 25 psi and/or keeps climbing. This means the pump was successfully switched on.   
9. **Turn on the water heater:** go back to the electrical panel and turn on breakers 28 and 30 (marked hot water). They should go the same direction as all the other breakers on their side.   
10. Finally, go upstairs and run the water on both hot and cold for a minute or two each. You may see grey water coming out \- this is normal. Run it until it goes clear. 

The water & heater are on\! 

### **Turn on heat pumps & light a fire**

**Heat pumps**

* Each heat pump has a white remote in their rooms.   
* Living room heat pump stays on at 16 degrees, so use the remote to turn up the heat (arrows).   
* For the master and guest bedroom, press the yellow button to turn on the heat pump and use the arrows to control the temperature. 

**Baseboards**

* If anyone is staying in a room without a heat pump, turn up the temperature on the electric baseboards via the wall control thermostat or use the knob on the baseboard heater.

**Woodstove**

* Start the woodstove in the kitchen and keep it going.  
* See [Lighting a fire](#lighting-a-fire).  
* You can light a living room fire but it should be emptied of ashes before leaving.  
  **Note:** To make sure the fire is cool enough before closing up the house, don’t put anymore wood on the fire 6-12 hours before departure. If there are hot ashes or coals, please empty them before leaving. Same with the living room fire.

## Sauna

Preparation is key\! Get the sauna going early, so you can enjoy it later. It takes a good 3 hours in summer, and 4-6 hours in winter to get to a good running temperature (45-60 C) \- the time depends a lot on your fire building and tending skills and how often you check on it\! 

**Vents**  
There’s a small vent in the top corner of the sauna, it should be closed when you’re starting the sauna, and left open while you’re using it and after you’re done while it cools down. This lets the humid air escape. 

**Water on the Rocks**  
Go nuts, pour water on there. 2-3 ladles at a time works well. The water should almost immediately turn to steam \- if it’s not, and most of the water is dripping down the rocks the rocks probably aren’t hot enough. There’s a drain in the floor for excess water.   
   
**Starting the fire**  
Same principles as the fireplace lighting procedure. Small wood and kindling to start, and make sure the fire gets extra air by opening the ash drawer at the bottom of the stove a few centimeters. Once you’ve got a few small logs on there and it’s burning well (usually takes 10-15 minutes), make sure to close the drawer or you’ll burn out your fire. 

Stay out there for the first 15 minutes to make sure you get the fire going well. Once you’ve put some bigger logs on, check back in 30 minutes to make sure it’s going well, if the fire is dying, pop the drawer open for 2-3 minutes and try adding some smaller wood or kindling. Once the fire is going well and you’ve added bigger logs, check back every 40 minutes to an hour. If you are going out for a ski or a walk, you can leave it, but you may have to stoke the fire again with small logs when you return\!

# Departure Checklist (Winter)

Basically the arrival steps but in reverse:

### Turn off/down heat & clean woodstove

- [ ] Turn down any baseboard heaters (wall thermostats) down to 10 degrees.  
- [ ] Turn off Heat pumps (yellow button) in the master and bedroom above the kitchen.  
- [ ] Turn the heat pump in the living room down to 16 degrees.  
- [ ] Make sure the woodstove is out. **If there are any hot coals or ashes, shovel them into the metal bucket and dump them in the snow away from the house. Same goes for the sauna stove**. 

### Turn off water breakers & lights

- [ ] Go to the electrical panel, turn off breakers 28, 29, 30, 31\.   
- [ ] Turn off basement lights.   
- [ ] Turn off the rest of the lights in the house.

### Empty garbage & lock up

- [ ] Empty garbage & compost (if you can please take this home with you).  
- [ ] Lock all doors from the inside except the shop door.   
- [ ] Lock the shop door last with the keys.  
- [ ] Put keys back in the lockbox. Scramble the lockbox code. 

### Helpful extra jobs \- not required, but it will help us\!

- [ ] Check the mail, the key is on the same ring as the house keys. Mailbox is about 500 meters back up our road towards Tremblant, on your left side. Ours is number 8, bottom middle, on the left hand locker (if you’re facing them). You can put this mail on our table at home.   
- [ ] Drive the Rav4 into town or around for 10 minutes. Keys are in the dining room buffet, top right drawer.   
- [ ] Chopping wood for the sauna and woodstove.  
- [ ] Put garbage out for collection if you’re there during the week, see [Garbage, compost, recycling](#garbage-compost-recycling) and the schedule below.

### 

# Parking

Whenever possible, try to leave the driveway loop free of cars, gear, etc. so that the snowplow can clear the whole loop without obstacles. The plow comes by when there’s been enough snow. Best spot to park is where any of the cars are in these photos or in the green space. If there’s no place and you have to park in the driveway, don’t worry, it just means you may need to clear a bit of snow close to the car. 

  


# Woodstove

The woodstove/kitchen fireplace is the stove to keep burning. Living room fireplace is nice, but a little tricky to keep burning. 

### Wood management

The wood box and stove alcove should be filled before departure. Bring in more wood from the shed as needed. A full woodbox will last about two days. Smaller logs to help a fire get started are kept in the small box beside the wood shed. Kindling is stored in the basement by the bike bunks.

The wood shed is divided into three sections and the wood is organized into those sections by dryness. The sections are labeled as **Wet** (right section), **Med** (middle), and **Dry** (left). Use wood from the section labeled **Dry**. 

If Dry is empty, use the wood from Med. 

You may need to chop some wood to make smaller kindling for starting the fire. 



### Dampers

The woodstove has two dampers: “upper” and “lower”. The dampers control the amount of air entering the fireplace which controls the temperature and intensity of the fire. When a good fire is going, both dampers should be closed. This will slow the pace of the fire, preserving wood, and keep the temperature at a predictable level. 

**Caution**: the dampers are HOT. Put on the glove or use the poker to open/close.  


The “lower” damper is used only when lighting the fire or if the fire has died down.   


The “upper” damper is used to control the intensity of an established fire. When the fire starts to die or you put a new piece of wood on, open the upper damper.   


### Lighting a fire

1. If the ashes are cool, empty them.   
2. If the ashes are still hot and glowing, stir them up and use them to help start the new fire.   
3. Open up both dampers.   
4. Crumple up some paper and put it in the woodstove.  
5. Place kindling on top of the paper.   
6. Light the paper.   
7. Close the door. The lower damper should suck air into the paper/kindling.   
8. Once the kindling is lit, place some smaller logs on.   
9. Once the smaller logs have caught, you can close the lower damper.   
10. Watch fire. If it starts to die, open the lower damper or put in more paper/kindling.   
11. Once the fire is going steady with the smaller logs, add a larger log.   
12. Once the larger log is burning well, you can close the upper damper.   
    Congratulations\! You’ve lit a fire. Keep an eye on it so it doesn’t go out and you have to start from scratch. 

**Important:** you do not need to keep feeding the fire to have it raging hot. A large log slowly burning will put out enough heat. A good steady fire will only need a log added every hour or 2\. A high temperature fire increases the risk of a chimney fire (this is why you close the damper once the fire is going, to reduce intensity). 

### Ashes

Empty the ashes into the blue metal bucket beside the fireplace. If it is full, dump the ashes down the hill at the edge of the front yard. 

**Important**: if the ashes are not cold enough, they will continue to smoke and burn in the bucket. This is dangerous. If they’re still hot, smoking etc. empty the bucket outside. 

### Chimney Cleaning

The chimneys are cleaned annually (see table at the bottom for info), but you can help by adding two capfulls of the chimney cleaning powder every 2-3 fires you have. Throw the powder on a low, hot fire (hint: red embers are good, do it when you’re about to add another log). This helps keep creosote build up to a minimum. 

# Heaters/thermostats

The rooms you use most have a heat pump unit, controlled by a white remote. Turn these on as you need (press yellow power button), and just select the right temp for you (up and down arrows). Then they will work automatically. We usually have it at 20 in the living room, and 16 in the bedrooms \- they give quite a bit of heat. 

Most baseboard heaters are controlled by a thermostat in that room. Some are controlled by a knob on the heater (i.e. second guest bedroom). You only need to use the baseboards in a room without a heat pump (sunroom off kitchen).  

**Note:** The sunroom/kitchen thermostat is located in the closet under the stairs. Quirky\!

It's preferable that you do not set the thermostat higher than 17C. If set higher than 17C, the heater will never shut off. If you do raise the temperature above 17C, remember to turn it down again at night or when you leave the room. 

# Garbage, compost, recycling

Garbage bins are at the end of our road, labeled 488\. Garbage schedule is on the fridge door. If it’s a day for the garbage/recycle/compost, put the bin at the end of the driveway by the road. They usually come in the morning around 10AM, so try to get it out the night before.

All recycling goes in one bin \- no sorting needed. 

* Garbage \= black  
* Recycling \= green  
* Compost \= brown

# Power outage

The power went out, what do I do???

* Don’t panic.  
* Keep up to date on the outage by checking the [Hydro Quebec](https://infopannes.solutions.hydroquebec.com/info-pannes/pannes/pannes-en-cours) outages map.   
* Go to the office to get the best cell signal, or if you need much better signal, the driveway or down to the end of our road by the garbage cans. 

**Light**: flashlight, candles, matches are in the laundry room cabinets. 

**Cooking**: BBQ, pizza oven, woodstove top. Propane for the pizza oven and BBQ are in regular-BBQ-size propane tanks on the covered porch. 

Cooking or boiling water on the stove top is slow, but it works. Open the upper damper all the way, and keep feeding the stove with wood until you have the water boiling.  

**Fridge:** Minimize opening the fridge and especially freezer. If you have stuff you’ll be accessing regularly, put it in a cooler (with ice in summer), put it in the workshop, or out on the deck. 

If it’s summer, get the cooler from the basement, you’ll need it. Go to town and buy bags of ice at the depanneur or grocery store and load up your cooler with all of your sensitive foods (milk, meat, etc.). Basement is the coolest place in the summer, so you can keep the cooler down there.

**Water**: 

* **Drinking**: If the power goes out, there are a few large jugs of water in the kitchen broom closet. These are for drinking/cooking/anything you need clean water for. The water in these is fresh and clean to use. Use the yellow kettle to boil water on the woodstove.  
* **Toilets, dishes**: For water you’re not ingesting, melt snow using a big soup pot on the woodstove. Once melted, empty into a plastic bucket from the workshop. You’ll need a lot of snow. If it’s summer or early fall use the rain barrel at the back of the house with the spigot on the bottom. To flush a toilet when the power is out, do your business and pour a bucket of water into the bowl, after a few litres, you’ll see the toilet flush itself.   
* **Important**: Do not use the taps, flush the toilets, run the showers, etc. They will work for a bit but then run out. It is best to keep water in the lines.  
  * **However**, If the power is out for more than 24 hours, go to the master bathroom sink and leave the faucet on at a very slow drip. This will keep the lines from freezing if the house gets too cold (don’t worry, this is very unlikely).   
* **Prepare**: If you see a big storm coming, fill the bathtub with cold water in case power goes out. You’ll be happy to have some extra water on hand.   

**After the outage troubleshooting**  
Did the water work for a while, but now there’s nothing coming out of the tap? That means the pump needs to be primed:

1. Go to the basement.  
2. Open the electrical panel that is immediately on your left through the first doorway.   
3. Look at breaker \# and make sure it’s not tripped (flip it off and then on if you’re not sure).  
4. Keep on moving to the far end of the basement, through the gym, to the room with the dirt floor.   
5. In the back right corner, you’ll see a gray tank, water pipes, and a small gray box with a metal arm.   
6. Lift this metal arm up slightly, it will give some resistance, and hold it steady at the middle point.  
   1. If you push it up too far, it will flick to the upward position.   
   2. If this happens, bring it back down and try again.   
7. Once you have it held in the middle position, watch the pressure gauge, it should start climbing.   
8. Hold until it hits about 25-30 PSI.   
   Congratulations, your water should be back up and running.
