# Woodstove

The woodstove/kitchen fireplace is the stove to keep burning. Living room fireplace is nice, but a little tricky to keep burning. 

### Wood management

The wood box and stove alcove should be filled before departure. Bring in more wood from the shed as needed. A full woodbox will last about two days. Smaller logs to help a fire get started are kept in the small box beside the wood shed. Kindling is stored in the basement by the bike bunks.

The wood shed is divided into three sections and the wood is organized into those sections by dryness. The sections are labeled as **Wet** (right section), **Med** (middle), and **Dry** (left). Use wood from the section labeled **Dry**. 

If Dry is empty, use the wood from Med. 

You may need to chop some wood to make smaller kindling for starting the fire. 



### Dampers

The woodstove has two dampers: “upper” and “lower”. The dampers control the amount of air entering the fireplace which controls the temperature and intensity of the fire. When a good fire is going, both dampers should be closed. This will slow the pace of the fire, preserving wood, and keep the temperature at a predictable level. 

**Caution**: the dampers are HOT. Put on the glove or use the poker to open/close.  


The “lower” damper is used only when lighting the fire or if the fire has died down.   


The “upper” damper is used to control the intensity of an established fire. When the fire starts to die or you put a new piece of wood on, open the upper damper.   


### Lighting a fire

1. If the ashes are cool, empty them.   
2. If the ashes are still hot and glowing, stir them up and use them to help start the new fire.   
3. Open up both dampers.   
4. Crumple up some paper and put it in the woodstove.  
5. Place kindling on top of the paper.   
6. Light the paper.   
7. Close the door. The lower damper should suck air into the paper/kindling.   
8. Once the kindling is lit, place some smaller logs on.   
9. Once the smaller logs have caught, you can close the lower damper.   
10. Watch fire. If it starts to die, open the lower damper or put in more paper/kindling.   
11. Once the fire is going steady with the smaller logs, add a larger log.   
12. Once the larger log is burning well, you can close the upper damper.   
    Congratulations\! You’ve lit a fire. Keep an eye on it so it doesn’t go out and you have to start from scratch. 

**Important:** you do not need to keep feeding the fire to have it raging hot. A large log slowly burning will put out enough heat. A good steady fire will only need a log added every hour or 2\. A high temperature fire increases the risk of a chimney fire (this is why you close the damper once the fire is going, to reduce intensity). 

### Ashes

Empty the ashes into the blue metal bucket beside the fireplace. If it is full, dump the ashes down the hill at the edge of the front yard. 

**Important**: if the ashes are not cold enough, they will continue to smoke and burn in the bucket. This is dangerous. If they’re still hot, smoking etc. empty the bucket outside. 

### Chimney Cleaning

The chimneys are cleaned annually (see table at the bottom for info), but you can help by adding two capfulls of the chimney cleaning powder every 2-3 fires you have. Throw the powder on a low, hot fire (hint: red embers are good, do it when you’re about to add another log). This helps keep creosote build up to a minimum.
