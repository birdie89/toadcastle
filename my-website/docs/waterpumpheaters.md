# Water pump & hot water heater

This is the most challenging \- and dare I say exciting \- part of the job, get ready\! 

1. Using the trapdoor in the workshop, go downstairs into the basement. The basement lights are immediately on your right on the ceiling/floor beside the trap door opening.   
2. Go to the electrical panel, located just after the first doorway in the basement. Immediately on your left you’ll see the electrical panel.  
3. Turn on breakers **29** and **31** if they’re off (Hint: everything else on that side/column is in the ON position, so the pump switches are ON when they’re in the same position as the other switches in their side/column.)  
     
4. Continue towards the far end of the basement, past the gym, and through the doorway into the dirt floor area. Light is above your right shoulder on the doorway, turn it on.   
5. Walk to the far right corner where you’ll find the pump and plumbing. You’ll see a grey box \- the pump pressure switch \- on the water pipe in front of the bright blue pressure tank. The pressure switch looks like this:   
     
6. This pump has a small metal switch sticking out, with 3 controls: **ON/AUTO** is at 9 o’clock, **START** is at 10:30, and **OFF** is at 12\.   
7. Move the switch to the  **START** position and hold for about 10 seconds. You should hear the sound of water rushing. Watch the pressure gauge climb and once it gets to about 25 psi, let go of the switch and the switch will move back to ON/AUTO.  
     
8. Watch the pressure for a few seconds to make sure it reaches 25 psi and/or keeps climbing. This means the pump was successfully switched on.   
9. **Turn on the water heater:** go back to the electrical panel and turn on breakers 28 and 30 (marked hot water). They should go the same direction as all the other breakers on their side.   
10. Finally, go upstairs and run the water on both hot and cold for a minute or two each. You may see grey water coming out \- this is normal. Run it until it goes clear. 

The water & heater are on\!
